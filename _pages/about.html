          I was born in a city called Aleppo located near the northern Syrian border. Aleppo is regarded as one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world dating back 
            to 12000 BCE.

            I started attending the American college for boys at the age of 12. I finished my middle school and high school there.
            Right around a young age, I had my mind set on becoming a computer engineer. It was always cool to be the kid who fixes laptops, download games and music 
            to phones XD, help the family around with their simple technology demands. I used to sit for hours going through the dial-up internet connection we had 
            back then to search new games, new music and cool knowledge; like how old retro games are made. In high school I had a huge interest on games and animes, 
            that was when I created my first form to share some content and fan made translations and art.

           I started my University life at Aleppo University, Computer Science department around 2012. I was young full of energy and passion eager to discover more 
            about the techonlogy world. Right around that time the Syrian revolution started taking a new turn as more and more cities became more involved. As one can
            expect It became very hard to sustain an academic life and my dream of pursuing knowledge in this domain satrted to fade away little by little.

           As I finished 2 years in my pursue for a bachelor's degree at the University of Aleppo, the Syrian crisis turned into a full-fledged war. 
           As much as it pained me to leave, I had to try and pursue another path to carry on with. I was granted a full scholarship through the YTP 
           Turkish Scholarship program to study Computer Science at Ataturk University. I had many hardships and lots and lots of great memories and experience
           It was challenging for me trying to learn a new language from scratch and adapting to a new life and new culture.

           My undergrad life experience came to an end in 2019. I graduate second in my class. I had a lot of fun, made a lot of unbreakable bonds and learned 
            a lot about computer architecture, data structures and algorithms, web and app development, microprocessors and embedded systems and my favorite subjects; 
            computer vision and machine learning. Perhaps my highlight moment for my undergraduate life in Erzurum, Turkey is that I met the love of my life there.

            As part of our university requirements, I took my internship at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Cloudstaff/" target="_blank">Cloudstaff</a>, a fun and friendly workplace. I got trained with a team of students and they eventually became my friends. There were so many fun activities and parties here.

            I got the chance to work with awesome people from USA. We worked together to build the core products of <a href="http://buckettechnologies.com/" target="_blank">Bucket</a>. I was the <strong>iOS Developer</strong> on the team. I also helped the Android guys whenever there was a chance.

    <ul>
      <li>
        I watch documentaries and read books that interest me: <em>biography</em>, <em>history</em>, <em>technology</em>, and etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Great people like <strong>Nikola Tesla</strong>, <strong>Albert Einstein</strong>, <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, <strong>Steve Jobs</strong>, and <strong>Bill Gates</strong> inspire me.
      </li>
      <li>
        Financially literate people like <strong>Grant Cardone</strong>, <strong>Gary Vaynerchuk</strong>, and <strong>Dan Lok</strong> educate me.
      </li>
      <li>
        I value education more than entertainment. I end up watching Neanderthals, Human Evolution, History of World Civilisation, Mongolian Empire, WW2, and other related videos online.
      </li>
      <li>
        I love self-improvement books and videos. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/phuckmediocrity/videos?flow=grid&view=0&sort=da" target="_blank">FightMediocrity</a> is one of the YouTube channels I am subscribed to.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every day, I learn <em>Stoicism</em> and <em>Zen</em> to gain wisdom.
      </li>
      <li>
        I should probably give time to learn the culture, tradition, and language of different countries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Music and playing the guitar used to be my passion. Not much anymore.
      </li>
      <li>
        I’ve rescued a few abandoned kittens since I was a kid. I just can’t see these poor animals die and not do something. Some survive while others don’t. People who throw these little animals away while they still can’t survive on their own need to get their crap together.
